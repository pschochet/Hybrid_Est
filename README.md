# Hybrid_Est
Under a “hybrid” multisite impact evaluation design, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conducted in some study sites, where feasible, and quasi-experimental designs (QEDs) are conducted in more sites, including the RCT sites (referred to as RCT-QED sites), to increase precision and generalizability. Estimation methods for hybrid designs are discussed in Schochet (Reference, 2026), which allows for hidden bias in the QED impact estimates after applying inverse probability weighting (IPW) to construct the comparison groups. A key feature of the hybrid design is that hidden QED biases can be corrected under the assumption that the QED biases estimated in the RCT-QED sites as a function of observed baseline covariates are transportable to the QED-only sites. 
The Hybrid_Est.R package facilitates estimation for hybrid designs in two ways. First, it estimates the bias functions—differences between the RCT and QED estimates in the RCT-QED sites—as a function of baseline covariates using a classification and regression tree (CART) supervised machine learning algorithm. Second, it estimates impacts by averaging the RCT estimates in the RCT-QED sites and the bias-corrected IPW estimates in the QED-only sites, with variances that incorporate estimation error in the bias corrections.
